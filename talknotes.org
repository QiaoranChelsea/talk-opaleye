* History
* Opaleye
* Table Defn
** Record definition
** Records are isomorphic to tuples => Just have names
** ProductProfunctor
** Id Newtypes
** Autoincremented IDs
* Query
** Columns are how we build up SQL fragments. Sourced from table selects, literals. Built up by operators.
** Queries have columns inside. We compose and nest queries to build up bigger ones. Queries are runnable.
** Everything
** Restriction
** Arrows
** Joining
** Projection
** Reusing Joins (Accessions + Loans)
* Insert / Update
** constant
** Insert
** Update
* Aggregation
** count  -  count books
** groupBy - Count books per keyword
** Other aggregate functions
** Pagination - Generalised Pagination
* Problems
** Dates
*** No support for unbounded
*** No intervals
*** No date functions (NOW(),date_trunc, etc)
** Newtypes
** No easy way to newtype limited length strings
** No easy way to prefetch one to many joins
* Conclusion
** 
** Profunctors & Product Profunctors are the secret sauce
